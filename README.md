# Inventory Management System Using YOLO, SingleStore, and OpenAI GPT-4

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates an advanced inventory management system. The system utilizes cutting-edge object detection techniques with YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, integrates with SingleStore for efficient data storage, and leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 for vision-based object detection insights. The goal is to automate inventory tracking, enabling sophisticated recognition, counting, and management of stock levels through visual analysis.

## Notebook Overview

- **Introduction**: The notebook begins with an introduction to the project's objectives, the technologies used (YOLO for object detection, SingleStore as the database, and OpenAI GPT-4 for vision capabilities), and the anticipated outcomes.

- **Environment Setup**: Details the initial setup process, including checking the GPU status with `nvidia-smi`, setting up the working directory, and installing necessary libraries such as `ultralytics`.

- **YOLO Model Training**: Describes training a custom object detection model with the YOLO framework, including specifying the task, mode, model, data, epochs, image size, and plots for training progress.

- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Shows how to load the trained model and perform object detection on sample images, visualizing and saving the results.

- **Bounding Box Data Management with SingleStore**: Explains the integration with SingleStore for storing and managing bounding box data from object detection results. This includes setting up the database connection, creating a table for bounding boxes, and inserting detection results.

- **Leveraging GPT-4 for Vision-Based Inventory Insights**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities to analyze images and estimate inventory levels, showcasing an innovative approach to obtaining actionable insights from visual data.

- **Considerations for AI-Driven Inventory Analysis**: Discusses the challenges and considerations when integrating AI into inventory management, including explainability, reliability, and the potential for future improvements.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For fast and accurate object detection.
- **SingleStore Database**: For high-performance, SQL-compliant data storage optimized for real-time analytics.
